# FFT Ocean Simulation 

## A FFT Ocean simulation I made for my university dissertation using OpenGL and C++

I was inspired by games such as Sea of theives to study how the FFT works and create my own implementation. This project demonstrates how the Fast Fourier Transform can be used to simulate waves in an ocean by using the inverse FFT to transform from the frequency domain to the spatial domain. The project includes the ability to adjust certain parameters such as:
* Wind Speed
* Amplitude (Depth of ocean)
* Length of each grid
* Grid Size (Resolution of the 2D height field)
* Tiling Ammount
